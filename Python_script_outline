Python programming project:
Mike shared a google doc with me BRapaRILs. 
This is a list of the labeled genotypes collected in the field, and the genotypes based on the SNPs.
Example: 402.04      303
The 404.04 represents the old RIL identifier, while the 303 represents the RIL based on genotype.
    The .04 represents the block that the RIL was in.
    Upendra will provide me with a list of the blocks and what treatments they represent.

I need to write a script that will do/incorporate the following things in python:
1: copy the old directory structure currently organized by block
2: make a symbolic link between the old file and the new file where the old file actually contains all of the seq data
3: pass bash commands in python (example ln -s)
4: try to use a library to work with the symbolic representations and/or for the bash command pass
5: Make new directories and links between BAM and fastQ files
6: Use Github to do all of these things
7: Use Trello to collaborate with Mike and Upendra

Symbolic links in Bash
ln  command makes a sold link
ln -s makes a soft link

Problems with the genotyping data:
1) significant contamination
       Figure out level of contamination threshold we will accept

2) How to rename things?
      Cody will make script that creates symbolic links between old and renamed files.
             This will potentially allow for reduced confusion in the future, and keep only one file

3) Identify break points
      HMM R package for Dan F
      Potential custom script from Mike, but we will wait to hear back from Dan

4) Upendra Re-maps parents
       Merge actual parent 1 and parent 2 and send the file to Mike
